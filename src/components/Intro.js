      Hi! My name is Erwin. I'm a software engineer here in the Philippines. 
      My job is to design and develop web applications also provide in-depth
      investigations, solutions, and work arounds for various issues across 
      different environments of the project. I'm also preparing for AWS 
      Associate Developer Certification that I plan on taking this year. 
      Other than IT stuff, I enjoy music, computer games, and most of all, 
      anime. Welcome to my website!
